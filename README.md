**Let's join forces and build something amazing together!**

## Talking About Collaboration
üåü I'm thrilled to embark on an incredible journey of collaboration with you! If you have any repositories you'd like to work on together, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm eager to contribute and help create something truly extraordinary. Feel free to reach out, and we can start building amazing things together!

## Next Step
- :rocket: I am currently embarking on a journey to become a full stack developer. My focus is on utilizing Node.js and Express for server-side development, MongoDB for database management, and I also aim to gain some knowledge in Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and deployment.   

- üíº In the upcoming months, I will be working on two significant projects, one personal and one for a client:
  - **Bongalo Clone**: I will be developing a web application similar to Airbnb called Bongalo. This platform will enable users to rent apartments across various locations in Africa. Additionally, it will provide property owners with the ability to host their properties on the web app.
  - **FinaccoHub**: For my client, I will be working on FinaccoHub, a course streaming application. This platform will allow users to stream and pay for courses related to professional certifications like ACCA, CFA, and more.

**Seems like the coming months will be fun** :smiley:
